## Project Description
**Computational Biology Helpers** is a highly interactive web application designed to make computational biology tools accessible to both beginners and experts. The platform features advanced visualizations, including 2D and 3D sequence alignments, powered by robust algorithms such as BLOSUM (Block Substitution Matrices). Users can edit, save, and share algorithm inputs and outputs for convenience. Our tool bridges the gap between software engineers and computational biology by emphasizing usability, scalability, and performance.

Key features include:
- 3D visualizations using **Three.js**.
- Type-safe coding with **TypeScript**.
- Seamless CI/CD deployment through **Vercel** and **GitHub workflows**.
- Clean, intuitive interface with light/dark mode support.

## Deployment
The application is live and hosted on Vercel. Updates are automatically deployed within minutes of being pushed to the main branch.
